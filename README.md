# dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles, managed with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

## Installation

To install these dotfiles, clone the repository and then use Stow to create the necessary symlinks:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harshitpawar64/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
stow .
# Or an individual config. example:
# stow vscode
```
